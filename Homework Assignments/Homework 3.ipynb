    "### 1. Out of 300 students in an Iowa high-school, 95 play cricket only, 120 play football only, 80 play volleyball only and 5 play no games. If one student is chosen at random, find the probability that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) the student plays volleyball\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(V) = 80/300 = 0.267\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) the student plays either cricket or volleyball\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(C ∪ V) = P(C) + P(V) = 95/300 + 80/300 = 0.583\n",
    "\n",
    "### c)  the student plays neither football nor volleyball\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(not F ∪ not V) = 1 - P(F ∪ V) = 1 - P(F) - P(V) = 1 - 120/300 - 80/300 = 0.333\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The seniors from an Ankeny high-school are required to participate in exactly one after-school sport. Data were gathered from a sample of 120 students regarding their choice of sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) For this group of students, does the data suggest that gender and sports are independent of each of other? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For independent events A and B, the probability that both occur is simply the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, we can use this to test for independence:\n",
    "#### P(Male and Basketball) = 10/120 = 0.08333, P(Male)*P(Basketball) = (35/120)*(47/120) = 0.114\n",
    "#### Since these are not equal to each other, we know that the events are not independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Two students are chosen at random from 120 students. Find the probability that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) both play tennis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(Both play tennis) = (25/120)(24/119) = 0.042\n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) neither play football\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(Neither play football) = (72/120)(71/119) = 0.358\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) One student is chosen at random. What is the probability that the student plays basketball given that the student is female?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(B|Fe) = P(B and Fe) / P(Fe) = (37/120) / (85/120) = 37/85 = 0.435\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Events A and B are independent. Suppose P(B) = 0.6 and P(A ∩ B) = 0.12. Find P(A).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)\n",
    "#### P(A) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.6 = 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The table below shows the number of left and right handed tennis players in a sample of 50 males and females.If a tennis player was selected at random from the group, find the probability that the player is\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) female and right handed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(F ∩ R) = 16/50 = 0.32\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) left handed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(L) = 5/50 = 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) right handed given that the player selected is male\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(R|M) = P(R and M) / P(M) = (29/50) / (32/50) = 29/32 = 0.906\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. A soccer team wins 60% of its games when it scores the first goal, and 10% of its games when the opposing team scores first. If the team scores the first goal about 30% of the time, what is the probability of wining a game? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(W| score first) = 0.6, P(W| not score first) = 0.1, P(score first) = 0.3, P(not score first) = 0.7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(W) = (0.3)(0.6) + (0.7)(0.1) = 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the most popular athletes in the worlds. From 2009 to 2018, he player for Real Madrid. Let X denote the number of goals that Cristiano scored per game in Real Madrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Find P(X ≤ 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.2 + 0.45 + 0.2 = 0.85\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Find P(X > 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(X > 1) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 0.35\n",
