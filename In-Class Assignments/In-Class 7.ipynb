    "### 1. In the 2018-2019 NBA season, the Golden State Warriors won 57 out of 82 games, which is a 70% likelihood of winning. Using this information, the Golden State Warriors plays the five games of the 2019-2020 season. Assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent from each other. Let X denote the number of games that the Golden State Warriors wins in the first five games of the 2019-2020 season.\n",

Using this information, the Colorado Avalanche plays the first three games of the 2019-2020 season. Assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent from each other.
